## ‚ú® Application Preview

![Application Preview](readme_assets/dashboard-home-page.png)

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Local Development)

This guide is for developers who want to clone the repository and run the project on their local machine first.

### 1. Initial Cloudflare Setup
[Cloudflare Wrangler D1 Commands Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#d1)

Before you can run the application, you need a Cloudflare D1 database and a KV namespace.

#### Create the D1 Database
Run the following command to create your D1 database. Replace `<YOUR_DB_NAME>` with a name of your choice (e.g., `my-app-db`).

```bash
bunx wrangler d1 create <YOUR_DB_NAME>
```

Cloudflare will return a configuration block. Copy this and add it to the `d1_databases` array in your `wrangler.jsonc` file. It will look like this:

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ... other configurations
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB", 
      "database_name": "<YOUR_DB_NAME>",
      "database_id": "<your-database-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```
Copy the output configuration and add it to the `d1_databases` array in your `wrangler.jsonc` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `binding` name must be `"DB"` as this is what the application code expects.

#### Create the KV Namespace
```bash
bunx wrangler kv namespace create "SESSION_KV"
```
Copy the output and add it to the `kv_namespaces` array in `wrangler.jsonc`.

This command will also return a configuration block. Add it to the `kv_namespaces` array in `wrangler.jsonc`.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ... other configurations
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "SESSIONS", 
      "id": "<your-namespace-id>",
      "preview_id": "<your-namespace-preview-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `binding` name must be `"SESSIONS"` as this is what the application code expects.

### 2. Database Migrations (D1)

To set up your local D1 database, apply the initial migration from the `migrations/` folder.
```bash
bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply <YOUR_DB_NAME> --local
```

### 3. Environment Variables & Secrets
[Cloudflare Wrangler: Managing Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret)

Your application requires secrets and environment variables to function.

#### Local Development (`.dev.vars`)

1.  **Create your variables file**: Copy `example.dev.vars` and rename it to `.dev.vars`.
    ```bash
    cp example.dev.vars .dev.vars
    ```

2.  **Generate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`**: See the [**`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` Generation Guide**](#better-auth-secret) below for instructions. Once you have the secret, paste it into your `.dev.vars` file.

3.  **Add Google Credentials**: See the [**Google OAuth Credentials Guide**](#google-oauth-credentials) below to get your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, then paste them into `.dev.vars`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Never commit `.dev.vars` to version control.** The file is already listed in `.gitignore`.

#### Production (Cloudflare)

1.  **Set Secrets**: You will need values for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. See the [**Generating Credentials**](#-generating-credentials) section below for instructions on how to get these. Then, add them to Cloudflare using Wrangler:
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
    bunx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    bunx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

## üöÄ Post-Deployment Setup Guide (For "Deploy to Cloudflare" Users)

Welcome! If you've just deployed this project using the button, these next steps are **required** to get your application fully working.

### Step 1: Configure Environment & Secrets

Your app needs secret keys for authentication and a URL to point to itself. You can set these from the Cloudflare dashboard without needing a terminal.

1.  In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages** and select your **New Project**.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Variables**.
3.  Under **Environment Variables**, add the following:
    *   `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: 
        *   **Value**: Enter the full URL of your worker (e.g., `https://<your-project>.<your-account>.workers.dev`).
        *   This one is **not** a secret, so do not encrypt it.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure to save as 'Secret' and not 'Text' for these:
    *   `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: 
        *   **Value**: Follow the [**`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` Generation Guide**](#better-auth-secret) below to generate a secret, then paste it here.
        *   Click the **Encrypt** button to keep it secure.
    *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`:
        *   **Value**: Follow the [**Google OAuth Credentials Guide**](#google-oauth-credentials) below to get your credentials, then paste them here.
        *   Click **Encrypt** for both of these as well.

### Step 2: Run the Database Migration

The deploy button creates your D1 database, but it doesn't create the necessary tables for users and sessions.

#### Method A: Using the Cloudflare Dashboard (No Terminal Needed)

This is the easiest way to set up your database schema.

1.  First, you need the SQL commands. Go to the migration file in the project's GitHub repository: [`migrations/0000_initial.sql`](https://github.com/jhomra21/cloudflare-workers-solid-tanstack-spa-betterauth-D1-KV/blob/master/migrations/0000_initial.sql).
2.  Copy the entire content of that file.
3.  In your Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to **D1** from the left-hand menu.
4.  Select the database that was created for your project. It will likely have a name similar to your project name.
5.  Click on the **Console** tab.
6.  Paste the copied SQL commands into the query box and click **Run**.

#### Method B: Using the Command Line (Requires Git & Wrangler)

If you're comfortable with the command line:

1.  **Clone your new repository** from GitHub to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**.
3.  **Run the migration command**, replacing `<YOUR_DB_NAME>` with the name of the D1 database created during deployment (you can find this in your Cloudflare dashboard).
    ```bash
    bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply <YOUR_DB_NAME> --remote
    ```

**Your application should now be fully configured and ready to use!**

## üîë Generating Credentials

This section details how to get the required secrets for the application to run.

### Better Auth Secret

This is a random, secret key used by the `better-auth` library for encryption.

1.  Navigate to the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#set-environment-variables) and use their built-in generator.
    ![Generate Secret Button](readme_assets/better-auth-secret.png)
2.  Copy the generated secret.
    ![Generated Secret](readme_assets/better-auth-secret-generated.png)

### Google OAuth Credentials

To enable Google Sign-In for your application, you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

1.  Navigate to the [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page in your Google Cloud project. Click on **+ Create credentials**.
    ![Create Credentials](readme_assets/google-Oauth-create-credentials.png)

2.  From the dropdown menu, select **OAuth client ID**. For the **Application type**, choose **Web application**.
    ![Select OAuth client ID](readme_assets/google-Oauth-create-credentials-Oauth-client-id.png)

3.  Configure your OAuth client ID:
    *   Give it a descriptive **Name** (e.g., "Cloudflare Worker Auth").
    *   Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, you must add the callback URLs for both your local development environment and your deployed application.
        *   For local development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
        *   For production: `https://<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/api/auth/callback/google` (replace `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>` with your actual worker's URL).
    ![Configure Redirect URIs](readme_assets/google-Oauth-authorized-redirect-url.png)

4.  Click **Save**. Google will provide you with a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.

5.  You must add these values as secrets for your project, either in your `.dev.vars` file for local development or in the Cloudflare Dashboard for production.

> [!NOTE]
> **After adding new environment vars or secrets, you must redeploy your worker. Either via dashboard or git**

## üîß Technical Deep Dive
The template uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Solid-js](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Tanstack Solid Router](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/adapters/solid-router), [Better-auth](https://better-auth.dev/), and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### Database & API Architecture
This project uses a Cloudflare-centric database strategy:

- **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite): Centralized storage for authentication data (users, accounts, etc.) and application data.
- **Cloudflare KV**: Utilized for session storage, enabling fast edge validation of user sessions.
- **Convex**: Real-time database and backend application platform for managing application data like tasks.

The backend API is built with **Hono.js** and runs on Cloudflare Workers, providing a lightweight and high-performance serverless foundation.

### Client-Side Authentication & State Management
User authentication state on the client is managed by TanStack Query, providing a robust, cacheable, and reactive "source of truth" for the user's session.

-   **API Client**: The `better-auth/client` library, initialized in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`, handles the low-level communication with the backend authentication API.
-   **Session Caching**: A global query with the key `['session']` is responsible for fetching and caching the user's session data. This is defined in `src/lib/auth-guard.ts` within `sessionQueryOptions`.
-   **Authentication Actions**: Custom mutation hooks in `src/lib/auth-actions.ts` (e.g., `useSignInMutation`, `useSignUpMutation`) wrap `authClient` methods. They leverage TanStack Mutation to handle the entire lifecycle of an auth action‚Äîsubmitting data, updating cache on success, and handling errors.
-   **Route Protection**: TanStack Router's `loader` functions are used to protect routes. The `protectedLoader` in `src/lib/auth-guard.ts` ensures that a valid session exists before rendering a protected route, redirecting to `/auth` if not.
-   **Sign-Out**: The `useSignOutMutation` hook orchestrates the sign-out process. It calls the auth client, and upon success, immediately clears the `['session']` from the query cache for a snappy UI update before redirecting the user.

This setup decouples UI components like `src/routes/auth.tsx` and `src/components/nav-user.tsx` from the underlying API logic, allowing them to simply use these dedicated hooks and the `['session']` query to manage and display authentication state.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> ### Custom Authentication Hashing for Cloudflare Workers
>
-   A critical consideration when deploying to Cloudflare Workers, especially on the free plan, is CPU time limitations. The default password hashing and verification functions provided by `better-auth` are computationally intensive by design to maximize security. However, this can lead to exceeding the CPU time limits on the free tier, resulting in `503` errors during sign-up or sign-in.

-   To mitigate this, this template provides custom `hashPassword` and `verifyPassword` functions within `auth.ts`. These functions use `scrypt` from `node:crypto` with parameters tuned to provide compatibility and security while remaining within the CPU constraints of the Cloudflare Workers free plan. This ensures that email and password authentication remains reliable without causing server timeouts.

### OAuth Callback Handling in Development

> [!NOTE]
> **The OAuth SPA Problem**
> When using a Single-Page Application (SPA) framework like SolidJS with Cloudflare Pages and the Vite plugin, a specific challenge arises with OAuth callbacks (e.g., from Google Sign-In) in the local development environment. Cloudflare's SPA routing intercepts the callback (e.g., to `/api/auth/callback/google`) and serves the `index.html` instead of passing the request to your backend Hono worker. This prevents the server-side authentication from completing.

**The Solution:**

The solution is to embrace this SPA behavior by creating a dedicated client-side route to handle the callback.

1.  **Create a specific route** in your client-side router (e.g., TanStack Router) that matches the callback path.
2.  **The component for this route** has a single responsibility: to immediately make a `fetch` request to the *exact same URL* it's currently on (`window.location.href`).
3.  **This `fetch` request is the key.** Unlike the initial browser navigation, a `fetch` is an API request. The Vite server and the Cloudflare plugin correctly route this `fetch` request to your backend Hono worker.
4.  The backend worker then processes the OAuth code, creates a session, and responds to the `fetch` call.
5.  Upon receiving a successful response, the component uses the client-side router's `navigate` function to redirect the user to their intended destination (e.g., `/dashboard`).

This approach creates a seamless "shim" within your client application that correctly bridges the OAuth redirect and your backend API, working in harmony with the SPA development server.

## üóù Setting up Google OAuth Credentials

To enable Google Sign-In for your application, you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

1.  Navigate to the [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page in your Google Cloud project. Click on **+ Create credentials**.
    ![Create Credentials](readme_assets/google-Oauth-create-credentials.png)

2.  From the dropdown menu, select **OAuth client ID**. For the **Application type**, choose **Web application**.
    ![Select OAuth client ID](readme_assets/google-Oauth-create-credentials-Oauth-client-id.png)

3.  Configure your OAuth client ID:
    *   Give it a descriptive **Name** (e.g., "Cloudflare Worker Auth").
    *   Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, you must add the callback URLs for both your local development environment and your deployed application.
        *   For local development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
        *   For production: `https://<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/api/auth/callback/google` (replace `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>` with your actual worker's URL).
    ![Configure Redirect URIs](readme_assets/google-Oauth-authorized-redirect-url.png)

4.  Click **Save**. Google will provide you with a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.

5.  You must add these values as secrets for your project, either in your `.dev.vars` file for local development or in the Cloudflare Dashboard for production.

## Convex Integration Setup
This project uses [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) for real-time data management. To connect your frontend application to your Convex backend, you must configure a build-time environment variable in your Cloudflare Worker settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are **Build variables**, which are different from the runtime **Environment Variables** and **Secrets** you configured earlier. Build variables are injected when Cloudflare builds your application, not when it runs.

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to your Worker (**Workers & Pages** > **your-project-name**).
2. Go to the **Settings** tab and select the **Build** option in the sub-navigation. Or just click on the settings link in the Build and deployments card.
3. Find the **Variables and secrets** section in the Build section.
4. Click **+ Add** and create a new variable:
    - **Name**: `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
    - **Value**: Your full Convex deployment URL (e.g., `https://great-lemur-123.convex.cloud`).
    - **Do NOT encrypt this value.** It needs to be available as plain text during the build process.

![Cloudflare Build Variables and Secrets](readme_assets/cf-workers-build-vars-and-secrets.png)

This ensures that your application knows where to find your Convex backend when it's compiled by Vite. After adding the variable, you may need to trigger a new deployment for the changes to take effect.
